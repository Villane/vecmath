h1. Vector Math Library for 2D Games

VecMath implements immutable 2D vectors, matrices and transforms for use in 2D games and game engines written in Scala.

h2. Currently being updated

Note: the code is currently compiling against Scala 2.9 to work with the latest Scala IDE wip_experiment branch, but should work on Scala 2.8.

*vecmath-optimizer* is a Scala compiler plug-in that worked with 2.7.5 but doesn't work any more. It may get updated in the future. If you want to use just the library, you can remove vecmath-optimizer and vecmath-test modules from the parent pom.xml.
